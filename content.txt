E10371157 – youTHrive

youTHrive is a forward-thinking organization dedicated to empowering individuals by unlocking their potential through innovative learning experiences. Although we have extensive experience in adult training and VET in secondary education, we are new to Erasmus+, which offers an advantage in evaluation scoring. We can offer quality management—Marika Huber is an external quality evaluator for Erasmus projects—as well as a variety of innovative training tools, including the creation of training videos in various languages and podcasts.

Our travel is limited to one person, with a maximum of three trips per project, and each trip lasting no more than two nights. We do not have the capacity to send people overseas for mobilities, so we ask to be excluded from such events. However, we are open to organizing a training event in Malta. We do not offer MOOCs.

youTHrive specializes in delivering tailored programs designed to meet the unique needs of individuals from disadvantaged backgrounds. We understand the importance of using engaging and accessible methods, blending animated videos, vibrant graphics, and gamification techniques to create enjoyable learning environments that support real-world application.

Our expertise spans digital skills, labour market training, financial education, and teacher development. We are committed to fostering inclusive learning environments, particularly for individuals on the autism spectrum and those with ADHD. In Malta’s multicultural context, we collaborate with adult trainers, secondary schools, VET institutions, and HEIs to implement tools that effectively support and engage diverse communities.

Our areas of focus include gender equality, where we work to empower women and men through leadership, entrepreneurship, and STEM training while raising awareness about gender bias and ensuring equal access to opportunities. In youth development, we provide tools for modern success, promote active citizenship, and ensure accessibility for marginalized groups, inspiring a generation of confident, capable youth. In entrepreneurship, we foster entrepreneurial mindsets through training, mentorship, and support for startups addressing social challenges. We also prioritize media literacy by educating youth to critically evaluate media, combat misinformation, and promote ethical journalism. Through all of this, we emphasize the use of innovative learning tools that incorporate gamification, digital platforms, and experiential learning to enhance both engagement and accessibility.

Our mission is to nurture individuals through education and personal growth initiatives tailored to today’s needs, with the aim of fostering positive societal change through innovation and inclusivity.

youTHrive has extensive experience in the areas relevant to this project. Our background in digital skills training, financial and social entrepreneurship education, and teacher training equips us to deliver programs that make a real impact. We approach each participant as an individual, designing programs with sensitivity and adaptability to ensure everyone has the opportunity to thrive. Given Malta’s multicultural population—where a significant percentage of students are migrants—we work actively to design and implement innovative learning tools that support these diverse communities.

Kevin Spiteri brings a wealth of experience in training both youth and adult workers, educational consultancy, and course evaluation. He specializes in addressing the challenges faced by educators and learners as they adapt to the digital age. For this project, Kevin contributes his expertise in developing training tools and professional development programs for adult trainers, along with course evaluation methodologies. His open mindset and deep knowledge of educational tools allow him to share innovative ideas, testimonials, and best practices that support youth workers in developing key transversal and didactic skills for the evolving labour market. Kevin is committed to promoting inclusiveness and a strategic approach to educational activities, guiding trainers on how to best support learners entering or already in the workforce.

Marika Huber brings extensive experience in European project management, leadership, and financial management, particularly within the Erasmus+ program. She has worked on projects related to female empowerment in the workplace and is currently participating in two Erasmus+ adult education projects focused on gender equality—'Power' and 'Equaliser'. In her previous role as Managing Director of the Mediterranean Bank Network, Marika was instrumental in building relationships that supported social entrepreneurship, facilitating partnerships and initiatives that empowered female entrepreneurs. As Director at the Malta Institute of Management, she contributed significantly to the professional development of trainers and organizations, with a strong focus on training and capacity building in the labour market. Marika earned her MBA from Maastricht in 2003.

Although we are new to the Erasmus+ program, we are a highly knowledgeable entity in the field of emerging digital technologies and offer "train-the-trainer" services. In the area of employment relations, we maintain strong ties with the Malta Employers’ Association (MEA), where Kevin Spiteri led their 2024 annual training event. Marika Huber has also collaborated closely with MEA on the EU-funded project "Regeneration Plan for Workplaces".

We believe that participation in Erasmus+ will contribute significantly to our strategic development by creating a more modern, dynamic, committed, and professional environment. It will also enhance our capacity for inclusive and responsive education. Through this opportunity, we aim to increase our understanding and responsiveness to diversity, including female empowerment and social, ethnic, linguistic, cultural, and ability-based differences. We expect to foster more active participation in society, promote a stronger appreciation for the European project and its values, and gain a better understanding and recognition of skills and qualifications both within Europe and beyond. Ultimately, this experience will help us improve our knowledge of educational practices, policies, and systems, while cultivating an increased sense of initiative and entrepreneurship within our organization.
